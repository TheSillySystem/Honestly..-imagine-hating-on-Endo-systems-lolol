They've done absolutely nothing wrong!! They are NOT faking DID because if someone were to fake DID they'd actually label themselves as having DID instead of using the endogenic label :3!! Also no where does it say that you have to have trauma to have DID anyways heh... just Google it LMAO!!!! It says a LIKELY cause not a HAVE TO HAVE cause!! :D BTW.. heh.. no endo system is claiming to have did unless they've actually been diagnosed


The definition of an Endogenic System -> A system who either: A: Formed without trauma, B: Formed due to trauma but chooses not to identify with it or C: Wasn't formed entirely by trauma
The definition of a Traumagenic System -> A system formed entirely by trauma

Wow not that hard to comprehend right?? Exactly!! Endogenic systems can't control the fact they didn't form due to trauma!! So why are you being so fucking spiteful huh? Why do you devote ur whole life to someone who can't control smthn.. pretty fucking ableist imo..
